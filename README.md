gravitroids
===========

A simple HTML5/javascript "clone" of Asteroids, but with gravity. 

To test this out, you can visit: [https://hallgeirl.github.io/gravitroids/src/Web/](https://hallgeirl.github.io/gravitroids/src/Web/).

Controls:
Up: Accellerate
Down: Accelerate backwards
Left: Strafe left
Right: Strafe right
Shoot: Left mouse button
Aiming: Mouse cursor

A few notes:
- Thereâ€™s gravity; try not to fall off the screen.
- If you fall off the screen, you die.
- If you crash, you die.
- If you die, wait for 5 seconds and you will start again..
- I've not spent tons of time optimizing this, so you may experience some choppyness on low-end systems.
